## Description
The following application is a back-end application for an e-commerce site. This uses the Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with the e-commerce MySQL database.
It is meant to be used such that managers at retail companies may compete with other e-commerce companies by using the latest technologies in their backend. 

## Installation
1. Open up Insomnia/POSTman, Workbench and your IDE of choice (I used VSCode)
2. Fork the repo and open in your IDE
3. Install Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, dotenv
4. Import the database in Workbench, seed the database
5. Start the server and run all requests in Insomnia or Postman

## Usage
1. Seed database
2. Start the server
3. Run the appropriate requests in the Insomnia Core
